# Overnight Forecast Build - Status Report

**Run Started:** October 18, 2025 at 21:54:26  
**Models:** LightGBM Quantile, NGBoost (LogNormal)  
**Configuration:** Full dataset (599 SKUs √ó 12 folds √ó 2 models = 14,376 tasks)  
**Parallel Workers:** 12 cores  
**Timeout:** 90 seconds per fit  

## Status: ‚úÖ RUNNING

**Process ID:** 78770  
**Log File:** `logs/forecast_20251018_215426.log`  
**Progress File:** `models/checkpoints/progress.json`  

## Model Implementation

### LightGBM Quantile Forecaster
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Implemented and tested
- **Fixes Applied:**
  - Updated `fit()` signature to match base class: `fit(y: pd.Series, X: Optional[pd.DataFrame])`
  - Added index alignment and deduplication logic
  - Fixed `predict_quantiles()` signature to return DataFrame
  - Removed calendar feature extraction (now handled by pipeline)
  
### NGBoost Distributional Forecaster
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Implemented and tested  
- **Distribution:** LogNormal
- **Fixes Applied:**
  - Added robust index alignment between X and y
  - Added duplicate index handling (keep='last')
  - Proper error handling for shape mismatches

## Smoke Test Results

**Test Configuration:** 1 SKU (Store=0, Product=126), 12 folds, 4 workers  
**Results:**
- LightGBM: 12/12 tasks succeeded ‚úÖ
- NGBoost: 12/12 tasks succeeded ‚úÖ
- Checkpoints created in `models/checkpoints/lightgbm_quantile/` and `models/checkpoints/ngboost/`

## Configuration Changes

### `configs/forecast.yaml`
- Disabled all previously-trained models (croston variants, seasonal_naive, zip, zinb, ets, slurp_bootstrap, linear_quantile, knn_profile)
- Enabled only new models:
  - `lightgbm_quantile: enabled: true`
  - `ngboost: enabled: true`
- Updated timeout: `timeout_per_fit: 90` (reduced from 120s)

## Monitoring Commands

```bash
# Watch log in real-time
tail -f logs/forecast_20251018_215426.log

# Check progress
cat models/checkpoints/progress.json | jq '.'

# Verify process is running
ps -p 78770

# Stop if needed
kill 78770
```

## Expected Runtime

Based on previous runs:
- Previous 10-model run: ~6.5 hours
- Current 2-model run: estimated 1.5-2 hours
- With 12 workers and 90s timeout: should complete well within 8-hour window

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Models implemented and tested
2. ‚úÖ Background job launched
3. ‚è≥ Waiting for overnight completion
4. üìä Tomorrow: Analyze results, compare model performance
5. üéØ Evaluate if additional Priority B/C models should be added

## Notes

- Both models require feature matrix X (cannot use y-only mode)
- Pipeline creates features via `create_features()` and `prepare_train_test_split()`
- Index alignment is critical due to duplicate indices in feature creation
- Checkpointing enabled - can resume if interrupted
