# Overnight Forecast Build - Status Report

**Started**: 2025-10-17 02:43:53  
**PID**: 8283  
**Log**: `logs/forecast_20251017_024353.log`

## Models Running (10 total)

### ‚úÖ Fully Working Models (9)
1. **Croston Classic** - Intermittent specialist
2. **Croston SBA** - Intermittent specialist (Syntetos-Boylan)
3. **Croston TSB** - Intermittent specialist (Teunter-Syntetos-Babai)
4. **Seasonal Naive** - Simple baseline with bootstrap
5. **ETS** - Exponential smoothing (state-space)
6. **ZIP** - Zero-Inflated Poisson
7. **Linear Quantile Regression** - Fast ML baseline ‚ú® NEW
8. **k-NN Profile (CBR)** - Case-based reasoning ‚ú® NEW
9. **ZINB** - Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial (note: had 213 failures in previous run)

### ‚ùå Disabled Models (3)
1. **SLURP Conditional Bootstrap** - Has bugs, needs debugging in morning
2. **LightGBM Quantile** - Install issues
3. **NGBoost** - SSL cert issues in sandbox

## Expected Results

**Total Tasks**: 599 SKUs √ó 12 folds √ó 9 models = **64,692 fits**  
**Estimated Runtime**: ~40-50 minutes at 0.03s/fit with 11 parallel workers  
**Success Rate Expected**: 99.6% (based on test run, ~200 ZINB failures expected)

## Checkpointing

- Progress saved to: `models/checkpoints/progress.json`
- Checkpoints saved to: `models/checkpoints/{model}/{store}_{product}/fold_{i}.pkl`
- Results aggregated to: `models/results/training_results.parquet`
- **Previous test run preserved** (108 tasks from 1 SKU test)

## Monitoring Commands

```bash
# Check if still running
ps -p 8283

# Watch progress
tail -f logs/forecast_20251017_024353.log

# Count completed tasks
cat models/checkpoints/progress.json | python3 -c "import sys, json; d=json.load(sys.stdin); print(f\"{len(d['completed'])}/64692\")"

# Check status by model
python3 -c "
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_parquet('models/results/training_results.parquet')
print(df['status'].value_counts())
print('\nBy model:')
print(df.groupby([df['task'].apply(lambda x: x['model_name']), 'status']).size().unstack(fill_value=0))
"
```

## Morning Debugging Tasks

### 1. SLURP Conditional Bootstrap Issues

**Last Error**: Index out of bounds when accessing features

**Likely Causes**:
- Feature matrix (X_future) handling for multi-step forecasts
- NaN values in features not fully resolved
- Mismatch between history length and lookback window

**Debug Steps**:
1. Add detailed logging to `slurp_bootstrap.py`
2. Print shapes of X, y, X_future at each step
3. Check if fillna() is working correctly
4. Verify k-NN neighbors are valid indices
5. Test on single SKU with verbose output

### 2. ZINB Failures (213 expected)

**Error**: `p <= 0, p > 1 or p contains NaNs`

**Occurs**: During negative binomial parameter conversion for sparse/intermittent SKUs

**Options**:
- Add bounds checking and fallback to ZIP when parameters are unstable
- Or just accept 0.3% failure rate (still have 8 other models for those SKUs)

### 3. Optional: Install LightGBM & NGBoost

If you want to add these models:
```bash
# Outside sandbox
pip install lightgbm ngboost

# Re-enable in configs/forecast.yaml
# Run incremental build (will skip completed tasks)
```

## Model Performance Comparison (from test run)

All 9 models completed successfully on test SKU (Store=0, Product=126):
- Average fit time: 0.03s
- All generated valid quantile forecasts
- Ready for full-scale deployment

## Next Steps (Morning)

1. ‚úÖ Check overnight run completed successfully
2. üîß Debug SLURP Bootstrap
3. üìä Analyze model performance by SKU segment
4. üéØ Perform cost-based model selection per SKU
5. üì¶ Generate forecast SIPs for optimization module
6. üöÄ Run Monte Carlo policy optimization

**Good night! See you in the morning. üåô**
