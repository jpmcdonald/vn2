# Order Analysis Summary

## Executive Summary

This document answers three critical questions about our submitted orders:

1. **By how much did our order change compared to what was submitted?**
   - **Answer**: 0% change - submitted orders matched selector recommendations exactly (100% agreement across all 599 SKUs)

2. **What was the expected cost when we submitted (with 5th/95th percentiles)?**
   - **Answer**: Expected costs calculated with 90% confidence intervals for each SKU
   - Example: Store 2, Product 124 → Expected: 3.78, CI: [0.60, 11.00]

3. **What is the realized cost now that we have Week 1 data?**
   - **Answer**: Utilities implemented to calculate realized costs once Week 1 demand is observed
   - Comparison against confidence intervals validates forecast quality

## Question 1: Order Changes

### Finding: Perfect Agreement

```
Total SKUs: 599

Order Statistics:
  Submitted - Mean: 3.85, Median: 1.00, Total: 2309
  Recommended - Mean: 3.85, Median: 1.00, Total: 2309

Difference (Recommended - Submitted):
  Mean: 0.00
  Median: 0.00
  Total: 0
  Absolute mean: 0.00

Agreement:
  Exact matches: 599 (100.0%)
  Within ±1: 599 (100.0%)
  Within ±5: 599 (100.0%)
```

### Interpretation

The submitted orders (`data/submissions/jpatrickmcdonald_backup.csv`) match the selector recommendations (`data/submissions/orders_selector_wide_2024-04-15.csv`) exactly. This means:

- The submission was based on the selector's optimal model choices
- No manual adjustments were made
- All 599 SKUs used the recommended order quantities

---

## Question 2: Expected Cost at Decision Time

### Methodology

For each order decision, we calculate:

1. **Expected Cost**: Average cost across all demand realizations
   ```
   E[Cost] = Σ P(D=d) × Cost(d, I+q)
   ```

2. **5th Percentile**: Lower bound of 90% confidence interval
   - Only 5% of outcomes have cost below this

3. **95th Percentile**: Upper bound of 90% confidence interval
   - Only 5% of outcomes have cost above this

4. **Standard Deviation**: Measure of cost uncertainty

### Cost Function

```
Cost(d, I+q) = 0.2 × max(0, I+q-d) + 1.0 × max(0, d-(I+q))
```

where:
- `I` = starting inventory (on_hand + intransit)
- `q` = order quantity
- `d` = demand realization
- 0.2 = holding cost per unit
- 1.0 = shortage cost per unit

### Sample Results

#### Store 2, Product 124
```
Model: zinb
Starting inventory: 1
Submitted order: 18

Expected cost (at decision time):
  Mean: 3.78
  5th percentile: 0.60
  95th percentile: 11.00
  Std dev: 4.55
  90% CI: [0.60, 11.00]
```

**Interpretation**:
- Expected to incur 3.78 in costs on average
- 90% confidence that cost will be between 0.60 and 11.00
- High uncertainty (std dev = 4.55) due to demand variability

#### Store 1, Product 124
```
Model: slurp_bootstrap
Starting inventory: 1
Submitted order: 10

Expected cost (at decision time):
  Mean: 0.99
  5th percentile: 0.20
  95th percentile: 2.00
  Std dev: 0.59
  90% CI: [0.20, 2.00]
```

**Interpretation**:
- Lower expected cost (0.99) than Store 2
- Tighter confidence interval [0.20, 2.00]
- Less uncertainty (std dev = 0.59)

#### Store 4, Product 124
```
Model: ets
Starting inventory: 1
Submitted order: 15

Expected cost (at decision time):
  Mean: 1.50
  5th percentile: 0.20
  95th percentile: 3.00
  Std dev: 0.98
  90% CI: [0.20, 3.00]
```

**Interpretation**:
- Moderate expected cost (1.50)
- Moderate uncertainty (std dev = 0.98)
- 90% confident cost will be ≤ 3.00

### Portfolio-Level Expected Cost

To calculate portfolio-level expected cost:

```python
from vn2.analyze.order_analysis import analyze_order_decision
from vn2.analyze.sequential_planner import Costs

# Analyze all SKUs
total_expected = 0.0
total_ci_lower = 0.0
total_ci_upper = 0.0

for store, product in skus:
    analysis = analyze_order_decision(
        store, product, order_qty, demand_pmf,
        on_hand, intransit, Costs(holding=0.2, shortage=1.0)
    )
    total_expected += analysis.expected_cost
    total_ci_lower += analysis.expected_cost_5th
    total_ci_upper += analysis.expected_cost_95th

print(f"Portfolio expected cost: {total_expected:.2f}")
print(f"Portfolio 90% CI: [{total_ci_lower:.2f}, {total_ci_upper:.2f}]")
```

---

## Question 3: Realized Cost After Week 1

### Methodology

Once Week 1 demand is observed, we can calculate the **realized cost**:

```
Realized Cost = 0.2 × max(0, I+q-d_actual) + 1.0 × max(0, d_actual-(I+q))
```

where `d_actual` is the observed demand.

### Key Insight: Deterministic Starting Inventory

After observing Week 1:
- Week 1 demand is known (not uncertain)
- Starting inventory for Week 2 is **deterministic**: `I_2 = max(0, I_1 + Q_1 - D_1)`
- This reduces uncertainty for Week 2 order decision

### Example Calculation

Suppose for Store 2, Product 124:
- Starting inventory: 1
- Order placed: 18
- Total available: 19
- Actual Week 3 demand: 20 (when order arrives)

```
Realized Cost = 0.2 × max(0, 19-20) + 1.0 × max(0, 20-19)
              = 0.2 × 0 + 1.0 × 1
              = 1.00
```

**Comparison**:
- Expected cost: 3.78
- 90% CI: [0.60, 11.00]
- Realized cost: 1.00
- **Within CI**: ✅ Yes (0.60 ≤ 1.00 ≤ 11.00)

This indicates:
- Forecast was reasonable (realized within confidence interval)
- Actual outcome was better than expected (1.00 < 3.78)
- Demand was slightly higher than median forecast

### Forecast Validation

By comparing realized vs expected costs across all SKUs, we can validate forecast quality:

1. **Coverage**: % of SKUs where realized cost falls within 90% CI
   - Target: ~90% (by construction)
   - If much lower: forecasts are overconfident
   - If much higher: forecasts are underconfident

2. **Bias**: Mean(realized - expected) across SKUs
   - Should be near 0
   - Positive: forecasts systematically underestimate costs
   - Negative: forecasts systematically overestimate costs

3. **Sharpness**: Mean width of confidence intervals
   - Narrower is better (less uncertainty)
   - But must maintain coverage

### Implementation

To calculate realized costs for all SKUs:

```python
from vn2.analyze.order_analysis import analyze_order_decision

# After observing Week 1 demand
results = []
for store, product in skus:
    actual_demand = get_actual_demand(store, product, week=3)  # Week 3 when order arrives
    
    analysis = analyze_order_decision(
        store, product, order_qty, demand_pmf,
        on_hand, intransit, costs,
        actual_demand=actual_demand  # Include actual
    )
    
    results.append({
        'store': store,
        'product': product,
        'expected': analysis.expected_cost,
        'realized': analysis.realized_cost,
        'ci_lower': analysis.expected_cost_5th,
        'ci_upper': analysis.expected_cost_95th,
        'within_ci': (analysis.expected_cost_5th <= 
                      analysis.realized_cost <= 
                      analysis.expected_cost_95th)
    })

df = pd.DataFrame(results)
print(f"Coverage: {df['within_ci'].mean()*100:.1f}%")
print(f"Mean bias: {(df['realized'] - df['expected']).mean():.2f}")
```

3. **Confidence Intervals**: Provide uncertainty quantification
   - Typical width: 2-10 cost units
   - Wider for high-uncertainty SKUs
   - Narrower for stable demand patterns

4. **Realized Costs**: Can be calculated once Week 1 data available
   - Validates forecast quality
   - Identifies systematic biases
   - Supports model improvement

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Once Week 1 Data Available)

1. **Calculate realized costs**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/analyze_submitted_order.py --with-actuals
   ```

2. **Validate forecasts**:
   - Check coverage (target: ~90%)
   - Check bias (target: ~0)
   - Identify poorly calibrated models

3. **Update Week 2 orders**:
   - Use deterministic Week 2 starting inventory
   - Reduce uncertainty in Week 2 decision
   - Potentially adjust orders based on Week 1 performance

### Medium-Term

1. **Track performance over time**:
   - Build dashboard of expected vs realized costs
   - Monitor coverage and bias by model
   - Identify models that consistently over/under-estimate

2. **Improve forecasts**:
   - Recalibrate models with poor coverage
   - Adjust PMF spread for over/under-confident models
   - Consider ensemble methods for better calibration

3. **Optimize order policy**:
   - Analyze cost sensitivity to order changes
   - Identify SKUs where small order changes have large cost impact
   - Consider risk-adjusted ordering (e.g., target 95th percentile instead of mean)
