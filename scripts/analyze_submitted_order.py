"""
Analyze submitted order vs recommended order with cost analysis.

This script answers:
1. By how much did our order change compared to what was submitted?
2. What was the expected cost when we submitted (with 5th/95th percentiles)?
3. What is the realized cost now that we have Week 1 data?

Usage:
    python scripts/analyze_submitted_order.py

Output:
    - Console summary with statistics
    - Detailed CSV with per-SKU analysis
